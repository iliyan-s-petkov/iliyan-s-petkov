When not involved in training or consulting projects. I enjoy activities such as reading, martial arts, programming,
and learning new languages. I also love spending time with my family, discussing technology at conferences and workshops,
helping non-profit community initiatives, and tinkering with electronics and IoT, which fuel my creativity and curiosity.
